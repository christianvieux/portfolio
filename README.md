# My Portfolio

Hello! üëã This is the code behind my personal portfolio website. I built it to showcase my projects and share a bit about who I am with potential recruiters, employers, and fellow developers.

üåê **[Check out the live website](https://www.christianvieuxdev.com/)**

## About This Project

I created this using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It's a straightforward portfolio site that includes:
- Information about me and my journey
- Projects I've worked on
- My current tech stack
- Ways to contact me

## A Note About the Code

This was built primarily for my own use, so you might find some areas where the code could be more organized or better structured. While it works well for my needs, it wasn't initially designed with the intention of being a template for others.

That said, feel free to:
- Take inspiration from it
- Learn from what I did
- Use pieces of it for your own portfolio

## Getting Started

If you want to run this locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to check it out.

## Future Plans

I might clean up the code and make it more customizable in the future, but for now, it serves its primary purpose - showing my work to potential employers and collaborators.

## Questions?

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about anything in here. I'm always happy to help fellow developers!
